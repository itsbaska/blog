Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Baska. I am a software engineer currently working at a software consultancy called 8th Light. I am a bit of a third culture kid. I grew up in Mongolia and Australia. In a past life I made a living as a graphic designer. I strive to write good code. In my free time I enjoy illustrating, climbing, and cooking.
