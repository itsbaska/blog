Today I am one week away from my last day at 8th Light. These past few days I have been reflecting on all the events that have happened since I started my career change.

My first day at 8th Light was May 14th, 2018. I vividly remeber arriving to the Chicago office a little too early. Rather than walking in awkwardly early I went to Do-Rite instead. I ended up ordering a chocolate old fashioned donut, and a small black coffee. The tasks for my first day was mostly just HR related, even so, I remember being nervous and unsure about what I was getting myself into.

Since that day I have gotten to work on a variety of different projects, small and big. I have worked directly alongside 30+ different amazing people. I have grown as a human. I have added to my skillset.

The impact that working at 8th Light had on me came in the form of new habits and values.

I learnt about being a better me, just as much about being a better programmer. Here is a little list of habits that I previously did not have, that I have formed in this time:

- Waking up early

- Reading a bit everyday

- Limiting screen time

- Taking breathers

Before 8th Light I did not have clarity around what I valued in my work and career. I have realized that having a set of values helps me grow in the way that I would like to grow. Some values I have adopted are:

Intrinsic Values:

- Communication
- Mentoring
- Knowledge Sharing

Extrinsic Values:

- Work-life balance
- Transparency
- Friendships

Today I can say that I am so happy to have been a part of 8th Light. But I am also so very excited about what the future will bring for me.
